In this repo I used Bikes Sales Dataset to creat my first Dashboard usin Excel, as I followed the following steps:


1- Downloaded the datset.

2- Removed Duplicates using Excel.

3- Found and Replaced values have the same name using Find and Replace in excel.

4- Added new column(Age Brackets) to be more usefull than its initial column(Age) --> as I classified the ages into differnt Brackets.

5- Built 3 pivot tables to Summarize, Agregate, and visualize the data.

6- Finally, I built the Dashboard.
