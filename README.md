In this repo I used Bikes Sales Dataset to create my first Dashboard using Excel, as I followed the following steps:

1- Downloaded the dataset.

2- Removed Duplicates using Excel.

3- Found and Replaced values have the same name using Find and Replace in excel.

4- Added new column (Age Brackets) to be more useful than its initial column (Age) --> as I classified the ages into different Brackets.

5- Built 3 pivot tables to Summarize, aggregate, and visualize the data.

6- Finally, I built the Dashboard.
